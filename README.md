## Introduction

Momepy is a library for urban morphometrics. It provides tools to measure and analyze the form of urban spaces and structures. NetworkX is a library for the creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks of nodes and edges. Together, these libraries enable the analysis of spatial structures and the relationships between them.
